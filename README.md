#LPG-ui

This repo contains svelte. The server renders the site, there is no client side rendering. The site will work without javascript enabled.  

`npm run start` will build the styles and start the server on localhost:3001

As of now, this UI should only be used on port 3001 if it is to be used with the lpg-wso2-is server which is configured to run on port 9443.
