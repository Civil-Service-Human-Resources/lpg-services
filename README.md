##LPG-ui--svelte

This branch contains svelte (and svelte-cli) SSR. It also contains parcel for ease of client dev.


`npm run build` to build the client and server
`node server` to start the server listening on `1234`.

Add HTML components to `${ROOT_DIR}/components/`. `npm run svelte` is compiling components into js, which is useful for client side dev.
