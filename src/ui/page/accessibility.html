                <p>If you use Windows as your operating system, you should have:</p>
                <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li>Internet Explorer 8 or higher</li>
                    <li>Edge (latest version)</li>
                    <li>Google Chrome (latest version)</li>
                    <li>Mozilla Firefox (latest version)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you use Mac OS X, you should have:</p>
                <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li>Safari 8 or higher</li>
                    <li>Edge (latest version)</li>
                    <li>Google Chrome (latest version)</li>
                    <li>Mozilla Firefox (latest version)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you are accessing the platform from your mobile phone, and you use iOS as your operating system, you should have:</p>
                <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li>Safari 8 or higher</li>
                    <li>Edge (latest version)</li>
                    <li>Google Chrome (latest version)</li>
                    <li>Mozilla Firefox (latest version)</li>

                </ul>

                <p>If you're using one of the browsers (for example, Internet Explorer), but still experiencing problems accessing the digital material, you could install one of the other recommended browsers.</p>

                <p>Speak to your organisation's IT department if you’re having problems. You could try using a non-networked (stand-alone) computer or your home computer, tablet or smartphone, as these will not have the same security issues.</p>

                <h2 class="heading-medium">Unbocking pop-ups</h2>

                <p>CSL's onlone learning open in 'pop-up' windows. You may need to let your browse allow pop-ups from CSL.</p>
                <p>When opening online learning, you may get a message at the top of your screen asking you to temporarily activate pop-ups. Simpply right-click and 'allow pop-ups.'</p>
                <p>To allow (or unblock) pop-ups for all CSL online learning, you may need to hange your browser's settings. If you need help to do this, please contact your organisation's IT department.</p>

                <h2 class="heading-medium">Accessing material blocked by your organisation</h2>

                <p>CSL includes informal and bitesized learning opportunities, some of which are hosted on YouTube and other external internet sites. Where possible, this learning will be flagged so that you are aware that the learning opportunity is hosted external.</p>
                <p>Some organisations may block access to external sites. Speak to your organisation’s IT department if you need access to a specific piece of learning.</p>

                <h2 class="heading-medium">Reasonable adjustments</h2>

                <p>All Civil Servants should have access to the best learning solutions possible.</p>

                <p>Managers should take the necessary steps to ensure employees are offered the appropriate level of support so that they can access and use the same version of learning as their colleagues.  This includes people who use accessibility software and those who have other accessibility needs.</p>
                <p>If you are a line manager, or have accessibility requirements, you may find it useful to check out the policy around reasonable adjustment in your department and find out what support is available to help you, or to help your staff. For example, your Diversity and Equality team may be able to offer advice and support. Also, any guidance that came with your software may offer advice and action that may help you whilst doing e-learning.</p>

                <h2 class="heading-medium">Find out how to make the most of your devices</h2>

                <h2 class="heading-medium">Accessing PDFs using a screen reader</h2>

                <p>Care has been taken to ensure that learning opportunities that include a PDF either provide an accessible PDF or an accessible alternative.</p>

                <h2 class="heading-medium">Accessibility software support</h2>

                <p>If you use accessibility software and have any useful hints and tips about using your software for e-learning, please contact the helpdesk at support@civilservicelearning.uk (with subject: FAO Accessibility Support), so that we can share with the rest of the Civil Service community on these pages.</p>

                <p>We are also looking for people who may want to join a support group of accessibility software users, so that when people contact us with issues we can put people in touch with each other (we will not publish any names or numbers on the site, we will administer putting people in touch).  Do you have any other ideas, or best practice examples that we can use to support our accessibility software users accessing learning on the site?</p>

                <h3 class="heading-medium">Guidance for editors developing learning</h2>
                <p>All learning hosted on the platform should adhere to the 'Authoring LPG style and conventions' guide.</p>

                <p>Learning should either be accessible itself, and meet W3C AA accessibility using the WCAG 2.1 guidelines, or provide an accessible alternative.</p>
                <p>For more information about making online learning accessible, please see the GDS Service Manual's<a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/accessibility-for-developers-an-introduction"> introduction to accessibility for developers</a>.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-medium">Accessibility statement</h2>

                <p>This website conforms to the Guidelines for UK Government Websites, which support the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The website has been developed to meet W3C AA accessibility using the WCAG 2.0 guidelines, meeting AAA accessibility standards where possible.</p>
                <p>In most cases the e-learning on the site is accessible by all of the commonly used accessibility software solutions used across government (JAWS, Dragon, Supernova and Zoomtext). Each e-learning product has an 'Accessible' version that can be selected once the e-learning has been accessed. Most e-learning has the facility to change the text and background colour using the 'Settings', 'Options' or 'Toggle text colour' button at the bottom of the e-learning screen.</p>
